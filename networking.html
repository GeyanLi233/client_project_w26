                <h2>What is networking and why is it important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Networking is the proactive process of building professional relationships to share information, resources, and support. At the University of Michigan, it is a critical skill that bridges the gap between your academic studies and your future career.
                </p>
                <h3>Why is networking important?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><a>Access to the Hidden Job Market: Many positions are filled through referrals before they are ever posted publicly. Networking gives you a "first look" at these opportunities.</a></li>
                    <li><a>Industry Insights: Speaking with professionals provides firsthand knowledge about company culture, daily responsibilities, and necessary skills that textbooks cannot provide.</a></li>
                    <li><a></a>The Michigan Advantage: Engaging with the U-M alumni network connects you to a global community of leaders who are uniquely motivated to help fellow Wolverines succeed.</li>
